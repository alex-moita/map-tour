# map-tour

This code is from my live demo at the SFHTML5 Polymer meet-up.

1. Create a folder called `development`
2. `cd` into `development`
3. Clone this repo inside of `development`. Your file structure should look like this:

```
devlopment/
  map-tour/
```

4. `cd` into `map-tour`
5. Run `bower install`. Dependencies should end up in the `development` folder.
6. `cd` into the `development` folder.
7. Start a local server and open up `http://localhost:[PORT]/map-tour/demo.html`
8. Profit!!!!!!!
