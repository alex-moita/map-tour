# map-tour

This code is from my live demo at the SFHTML5 Polymer meet-up.

- Create a folder called `development`
- `cd` into `development`
- Clone this repo inside of `development`. Your file structure should look like this:

```
devlopment/
  map-tour/
```

- `cd` into `map-tour`
- Run `bower install`. Dependencies should end up in the `development` folder.
- `cd` into the `development` folder.
- Start a local server and open up `http://localhost:[PORT]/map-tour/demo.html`
- Profit!!!!!!!
